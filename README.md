MouselookHandler is an interface addon for the World of Warcraft MMOG that adapts the game
controls to enable using [mouselook][] without the [RSI][]-inducing requirement of
perpetually pressing the right mouse button.  This makes the controls resemble those of
most action games.

You can download MouselookHandler on [GitHub][gh/tags], [WoWInterface][], or
[CurseForge][].
